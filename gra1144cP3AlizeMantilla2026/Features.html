			<h2>About</h2>
	<p>Happily ever after never seemed so far far away when a trip to meet the in-laws turns into a hilariously twisted adventure for Shrek (Mike Myers) and Fiona (Cameron Diaz). With the help of his faithful Donkey (Eddie Murphy), Shrek takes on a potion-brewing Fairy Godmother, the pompous Prince Charming (Rupert Everett), and the ogre-killer, Puss In Boots (Antonio Banderas) who's a pussycat at heart.
