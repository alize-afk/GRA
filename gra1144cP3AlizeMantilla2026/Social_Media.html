	 		<p>To watch Shrek 2 right now (as of early 2026), your best bet depends on which subscriptions you already have!</p>
			<section>
<h3>Here is where it’s currently streaming:</h3>

<h4>📺 Subscription Streaming</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Peacock: This is currently the main "home" for the Shrek franchise. All four movies are usually available here.</li>

		<li>Netflix: Availability on Netflix varies by month due to licensing deals. It recently left Netflix in late 2025 but occasionally rotates back in.</li>

		<li>Disney+: In a rare licensing twist, Shrek 2 became available on Disney+ in certain regions (like the UK) recently, though this is likely a temporary deal.</li>
	</ul>

<h4>💰 Rent or Buy (Digital)</h4>
	<p>If you don't have the apps above, you can find it on all major digital storefronts for about $3.99:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Amazon Prime Video</li>

			<li>Apple TV / iTunes</li>

			<li>Google Play Movies</li>

			<li>YouTube Movies</li>
