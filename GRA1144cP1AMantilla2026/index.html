	<h3>Olive Garden’s Breadsticks</h3>
<p>Craving warm, garlicky breadsticks? Recipes for the popular buttery, fluffy, and perfectly chewy breadsticks.</p>
<section>
	<h4>Ingredients</h4>
	<h5>For the dough</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>1 cup plus 2 tablespoons (250 grams) warm water, about 100-110&deg;F* </li>	
		<li>1 &frac12; teaspoons instant yeast </li>	
		<li>2 tablespoons (25 grams) granulated sugar </li>	
		<li>3 tablespoons (42 grams) unsalted butter, melted </li>	
		<li>1 &frac34; teaspoons fine sea salt </li>	
		<li>3 cups (381 grams) bread flour, plus more as needed! </li>	
	</ul>
<h5>For the topping</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>2 tablespoons (28 grams) unsalted butter, melted</li>	
		<li>&frac12; teaspoon kosher salt </li>	
		<li>&frac14; teaspoon garlic powder </li>
	</ul>
	</section>	
<section>
	<h4>Steps</h4>
	<h5>For the dough</h5>
	<ol>
	<li>Prepare two baking sheets lined with parchment paper and set aside.</li>
	<li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment, combine the water, yeast, sugar, melted butter, and salt. Begin to gradually add the flour while the mixer runs on low speed. Increase speed to medium and knead the dough for about 10-15 minutes, or until it is tacky and very elastic. Add more flour, a tablespoon at a time, if the dough is extremely sticky.</li>	
	<li>Remove the dough and place in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rest in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour to 1 &frac12; hours (the exact proof time will depend on your kitchen environment; the warmer it is, the faster your dough will proof).</li>	
	<li>Once doubled in size, divide the dough into 12 portions (use your kitchen scale for accuracy, but it should be approximately 57 grams per piece). Roll each piece of dough into an 8-inch log. Place the dough logs on your parchment-lined baking sheet, about 2 inches apart. Cover, and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour to 1 1/2 hours.</li>	
	<li>Preheat your oven to 400&deg;F. Bake for 12 to 14 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove from oven and immediately brush with melted butter. Combine the salt and garlic powder and sprinkle evenly over breadsticks. Serve warm.</li>	
	<li>To refresh, place the breadsticks on a baking sheet, and reheat in the oven at 425&deg;F for 4-5 minutes, or until warmed through. You can also re-brush with butter and sprinkle again with garlic powder and salt, if you wish</li>
